Founded by and for students, the Portland State Aerospace Society is the largest project based student group at PSU. PSAS has two main engineering projects:

1. Building Oregon's [first satellite](http://oresat.org/) which as part of NASA's CubeSat Launch Initiative will go to space in 2020.

2. Competing in the [Base 11 Space Challenge](https://www.herox.com/spacechallenge/timeline/) to be the first university to send a liquid propelled rocket to the edge of space!

Additionally we've adopted an organizational model allowing business students to engage in administrative support and business development activities. We're caling this a **Space 2.0 Business Simulator**.

The purpose of these projects is to develop Portland State students into preferred talent for the aerospace and other high-tech industries.

Meetings take place almost every **Tuesday at 7pm at PSU in room FAB 86-01**. Come join us anytime!
See our Schedule section for detailed information on the where and when we meet.

## Open Source

Nearly all of the rockets we make, code we write and circuits we design are
published on the web. We track each and every change made to every file with
a [version control](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) software called [git](https://git-scm.com/).

[Github](https://github.com/) hosts all of our projects (called repositories). Browse through our whole stack at [github.com/psas](https://github.com/psas).

Dig into our files and read a lot more about how we're organised on our
**[projects page](/projects/)**.


## Get Involved

PSAS involves volunteers from all walks of life. You don't have to be a PSU
student to come help out.
