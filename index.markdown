Our long term goal at Portland State Aerospace Society is to put a
[tiny satellite](http://oresat.org/) into orbit. This is very
ambitious&mdash;there are so many technical, financial, and legal
challenges that we may never never get there! However, this goal
clarifies our intent and allows us to ask, "Where do we start?"

The answer is that we focus on small, ongoing projects which move us toward
our long-term goal. We build everything ourselves from the ground up and our
work necessarily touches all aspects of aerospace engineering. Our rockets are
in the amateur classification: smaller than commercial but larger than model
rockets. We haven't built the biggest or highest-altitude amateur rocket, but
we hope we're building one of the most sophisticated.

Meetings take place almost every **Tuesday at 7pm at PSU**. Come join us anytime!
See our Schedule section for detailed information on the where and when we meet.

## Open Source

Nearly all of the rockets we make, code we write and circuits we design are
published on the web. We track each and every change made to every file with
a [version control]() software called [git](http://git).

[Github](https://github.com/) hosts all of our projects (called repositories). Browse through our whole stack at [github.com/psas](https://github.com/psas).

Dig into our files and read a lot more about how we're organised on our
**[projects page](/projects/)**.


## Get Involved

PSAS involves volunteers from all walks of life. You don't have to be a PSU
student to come help out.

Keep reading about what we're doing. Follow us on social media:

Come to an intro meeting, usually held the first Tuesday of the month at 6:00pm
(check the schedule).

Jump into github and look at some our issue lists. There are always so many
things to fix!



## Upcoming Launch

We're working on a new rocket to launch in the fall of 2016. See
[our coutdown page](https://psas.github.io/countdown/)

### Projected Launch Date: Summer 2016


## Sponsors

We can't do this alone. Over the years we've been able to work with great
companies, many here in Portland.
