Call for Student Presentations!

We want to hear from students about their project efforts! We're looking for two kinds of presentations:

 
**Group / Project Presentations and Updates**

Come present your group, mission, and latest updates to other students. We're looking for presentations on anything going on in the PNW, so even small projects are encouraged to present!


**Technical Workshops**

Come present on your work and give other student groups the leg up they need. We're looking for everything from pintle engine design for liquid fuel motors, tips and tricks for carbon fiber air-frame layups, best practices for aerospace vehicle telemetry, open source projects helpful in aerospace, aerospace simulation tools, 3D printing for aerospace, rules and regulations you need to know for drones and rockets, etc.

If it's aerospace technology, we want to hear about!
