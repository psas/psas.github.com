Launch 12 was similar to the Launch-11 flight, though with many improvements to the ground infrastructure.

In 2015 PSAS participated in Intel's 'NUC Challenge' which allowed us to build an awesome permanent [mission control table](https://github.com/psas/flight-director-table) with many screens and a telemetry & control server.

On board this rocket were two Raspberry Pi computers attached to HD video cameras. The intention was to stream video live, though the camera dedicated to streaming failed minutes before launch so we flew without it. The failure appears to have been withe the ribbon cable attaching the camera to the Raspi. Also launched was an important experimental GPS module built by PSAS. The rocket recorded raw radio signals from GPS satellites while in flight in order to better understand the effects of rocket launches on GPS technology.

This flight had a student designed control experiment that attempted to dampen the spin of the rocket so camera views on the rocket stay steady for the whole flight. This kept the spin rate to under 80 &deg;/s, as contrast to the previous flight wich saw peaks close to 1000 &deg;/s!

 - Telemetry            | 300 baud Audio FSK

 **Launch Site**        | [47.8455689, -122.0482612](/)
 **Altitude**           | 0.36 km
 **Peak Velocity**      | ? m/s
 **Result**             | Success! The rocket and some data were successfully recovered.

Overall the flight was successful. There were a few things that went wrong.
The flight could have been more stable. We believe the instability was do to
using a modified kit rocket. The fins should have been scaled up somewhat to
allow more control surface. They were too small for the low airspeed we had.
The low airspeed was due to a very heavy 5.5 kg vehicle. Another problem was
our acceleration data from the PIC microcontroller sent down over the audio
channel was not frequency shifted at all. Upon later inspection we found a two
wires that had become shorted together. These problems will be fixed for the
next flight

The video feed worked great, with the exception of a couple of frames of snow,
the entire flight was captured at the ground station. The launch site,
surrounding countryside, and approaching thunderstorm could all be seen
clearly.
