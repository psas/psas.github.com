title: Senior Capstones
description: "Over the years we've involved dozens of engineering students through their senior capstone project, giving them invaluable experience working on hard real-world projects."
---

Each 6-credit, community-based learning course is designed to provide students with the opportunity to apply, in a team context, what they have learned in their major and in their other University Studies courses to a real challenge emanating from the larger community.

Each Capstone's purpose is to further enhance student learning while cultivating crucial life abilities that are important both academically and professionally: establishing connections within the larger community, developing strategies for analyzing and addressing problems, and working with others trained in fields different from one's own.
